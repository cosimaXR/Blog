# CG Study Notes

### ① How does this world become visual to us? 
- Color
- Form
- Depth
- Motion
Then explain how computer utilize those rules to generate vivid pictures/animation for us.

### ② How computer display?
- Color
- Form
- Depth
- Motion

### ③ Special display requirement in VR/AR.
Then I’ll move to invisible part of it.

### ④ What is the calculation process behind those displays? From 0 to 1.
- Color - Render
- Form - Model
- Depth 
- Motion - Animation
As I said before, CG is an subject about teaching computer to draw, and I can tell you that it is pretty similar to how we draw on a physical canvas. We first see the world with our eyes. Then we render what we saw onto a surface. In a similar way, computer see the digital world with its eyes, and render the pictures onto a digital screen.So the next thing I would to decompose the process of drawing as a human being and How do computer learn from it to draw an image for us to see? 
How can computer utilize those rules to draw? Then we shall start to learn how can computer hack down to our vision mechanism and draw the pictures that we feel it is real.

### ⑤ Photorealistic. Special computational requirement in VR/AR
When everybody is talking photorealistic in VR
It actually vary so much 
Sensed so subjectively by our minds
